# BELL Tx Clinical Trial Randomization Process

## Overview
BELL Tx is conducting a clinical trial focused on Cochlear Implant (CI) patients. To ensure the efficacy and reliability of our study, we employ a dynamic stratified randomization process. This approach is designed to evenly distribute patients across different groups based on specific hearing conditions and CI surgical factors.

## Stratification Factors
Patients are categorized and randomized into groups based on four key factors:

Unilateral/Unilateral CI: Unilateral hearing loss (normal hearing on the opposite side) + Unilateral CI surgery.
Asymmetrical/Unilateral CI: Asymmetrical hearing loss (hearing loss on the opposite side but not profound) + Unilateral CI surgery.
Bilateral/Unilateral CI: Bilateral profound hearing loss + Unilateral CI surgery.
Bilateral/Bilateral CI: Bilateral profound hearing loss + Bilateral CI surgeries.
